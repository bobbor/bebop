## About

modern webapps grow more and more. In size as well as complexity.  
But resources are limited on an internet of things.  
So the point was reached where "one-framework-fits-it-all"-solutions won't work.

This library aims to do DOM-Manipulation, Event-Handling and AJAX.  
Just the every-day business with such a library.

## So what can you do with it

### DOM

* finding nodes
* traversal
* removing nodes
* create and adding children to nodes
* change attributes and properties

### Events

* listening to events
* dispatch events
* unbind from events
* delegate events

### AJAX

* get
* post
* head
* put
* delete


### How to use
